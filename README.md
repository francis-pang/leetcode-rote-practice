# Rote Practice for LeetCode

This program is inspired by the book _Make It Stick_. I read the first few chapters of the book, and I am inspired to make a program that can track your learning progress. 

# Features
### Spaced repetition
This is the main feature of the program. This program allows you to see what is the list of programs that are due for repeated practice. You will be able to know which Leetcode question to do when you open this up.

# Getting Started
**I will write this once I have get the program to a working state.**

# Progress
There are a few tasks which I foresee that I need to do:
1. Build the schema for retrieval practice
2. Learn how to pull data from Leetcode website
3. Manually set up the Postman to pull data of past practiced questions
4. Pull data for a few questions
5. Insert and update the data into the DynamoDB
6. Write GoLang function to pull from Leetcode website
7. Automate pulling data
8. Pull data from DynamoDB for question to practice
